                  <h2>Training</h2>
                  In any field it is critical that a person is trained in what he or she does for a living.  With Iron Workers Local Union No. 3, training is an on-going process.  During the federally-approved apprenticeship program, iron workers are taught inside and outside the state-of-the-art training facility.  While the 840 hours spent in the classroom includes the standardized core curriculum, welding theory and procedure, blueprint reading, and safety standards, iron workers are learning to perfect their craft during the hands on classroom and on-the-job training.  Not only are apprentices learning the skills necessary to apply their craft on projects, but they are also taught the correct behaviors such as accountability, punctuality, and initiative which allow them to excel on your job site.  Once an apprenticeship is completed, the training and education continues with specialized courses, certifications, and advanced safety and health classes.  Approximately $45,000,000 is spent annually on apprenticeship and journeymen upgrade training.  Journeymen are encouraged to participate in the upgrade programs such as foreman training and welding certification so they can continually strive to increase knowledge, greater professionalism, and take the next step up in his/her career.  The international iron workers union believes providing a well-trained, highly-skilled workforce is the most important resource we provide our customers.
