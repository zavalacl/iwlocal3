      	<h1>Ornamental Iron / Curtain Wall</h1>
         
         <div class="main_left">
            <p>Ornamental includes the installation and erection of metal windows, curtain wall, and window wall systems.  These projects require a unique skill as these items typically cover the steel or reinforced concrete structure of a building and are usually fabricated from a variety of materials.</p>

				<p>In addition, ornamental iron working appeals to the creative side of our iron workers as they install and erect metal stairways, cat walks, gratings, ladders, doors, railings, fencing, gates, metal screens, elevator fronts, platforms and even entranceways. These “finishers” as known by the industry have completed their specialty training and are able to work with a variety of materials on diverse projects whether it is for commercial, industrial, or residential buildings.</p>
